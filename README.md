# Next.js 13 + Supabase + Stripe Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project that combines Next.js 13, Supabase, and Stripe to provide a starting point for building web applications. It includes a basic setup for integrating Supabase as the backend database and Stripe for handling payments.

Example:

[Working Demo: https://next13-supabase-stripe.zachuri.com/login](https://next13-supabase-stripe.zachuri.com)

## Features

- Next.js 13 App Directory
- Supabase
- Stripe
- Radix UI Primitives
- Tailwind CSS
- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)
- Dark mode with `next-themes`
- Tailwind CSS class sorting, merging and linting.

## Inspiration

I drew inspiration from Shadcn's innovative Taxonomy app, which provided a powerful categorization system. However, to enhance the backend functionality and streamline content management, I implemented Supabase as my backend solution. By integrating Supabase, I was able to efficiently store, organize, and retrieve inspiration content, allowing users to discover and explore curated collections based on the Taxonomy framework. This combination of Shadcn's inspiration and Supabase's backend capabilities resulted in a seamless and engaging experience for users seeking creative inspiration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm or yarn (package managers for Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zachuri/next13-supabase-stripe.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd next13-supabase-stripe
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

4. Configure Supabase:
   - Create a Supabase project at **[supabase.io](https://supabase.io/)** if you haven't already.
   - Retrieve your Supabase project URL and API key.
   - Copy the **`.env.example`** file and rename it to **`.env.local`**.
   - Update the **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`** and **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`** variables in the **`.env.local`** file with your Supabase project URL and API key respectively.
5. Configure Stripe:
   - Create a Stripe account at **[stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)** if you haven't already.
   - Retrieve your Stripe publishable key and secret key.
   - Update the **`.env.local`** file with your Stripe keys:

## **Supabase Setup**

1. Create a new project in your organization with a secure password.
2. Update the .env file with your Supabase environment variables:

   1. Navigate to Project Settings → API

   ```
   // Obtain in Supabase Project Settings
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
   ```

3. Navigate to Authentication.

         - Setup in Github Developer Settings:
           - Go to OAuth Apps.
           - Create a new OAuth Application.
           - Add the redirect URL from Supabase to the callback URL in Github.
           - Get the Client ID and Secret and add it to Supabase
   - URL Configuration:
     - Add a custom domain if needed.
     - Add additional Redirect URLs, including your localhost URL (e.g., **[http://localhost](http://localhost/)**).
4. SQL Editor:

   - Run the following SQL script to create tables and functions for authentication, Stripe, profiles, etc.:
   - Creating Queries for User Profiles and Stripe

     ```

5. Create types for Supabase:
   - Run the following command to generate typescript types:
     ```
     npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id [project-id] --schema public > src/types/supabase.db.ts
     ```
   - Make sure to add the generated types to your project in the specified location.

## **Stripe Setup**

1. Create a Stripe account if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to Developers → Webhooks
3. Use Ngrok to test on local
   1. Use a tunneling service like ngrok to tunnel your local development server.
   2. Obtain the forwarding URL from ngrok, which will be used for Stripe webhooks.
   3. Add the endpoint URL
      1. `[forwarding-url]/api/webhooks`
   4. Select events to listen to
      1. Select all events
   5. Reveal the signing Secret
      1. Copy the signing secret to → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your .env
4. Add your api keys
   1. Navigate to Developers to API keys
      1. Publishable key → **`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`** in your .env
      2. Secret key → `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in your .env
5. Test that you API works (Keep your ngrok tunnel online)
   1. Use the stripe cli to test your server
      1. stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   2. Create a product
      1. Add a product in Stripe:
         - This will trigger a webhook request to your API endpoint (**`/api/webhooks`**) and insert the product into your Supabase database.

Make sure to follow these steps carefully to set up Supabase and Stripe correctly for your Next.js 13 + Supabase + Stripe boilerplate.
